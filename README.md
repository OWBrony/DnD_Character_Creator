# Overview

The goal of this program is to be an experiment in building dynamic webpage.
I will be focusing on making a part of the page change its contents based on
what the user selected.

The web app will take the user through the process of creating a 5th edition character.
To set this up, one will merely need to open the html file with their preferred browser,
though the software will be tested with the Google Chrome browser.

# Web Pages
The one and only page will take the the user through the character creation process and will dynamically build as the user clicks buttons.

# Development Environment
This was made in VSCode using no libraries other than those built in to javascript.
The page was tested using Google Chrome.
The page was built in HTML and Javascript.
